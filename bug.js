In React Router Dom v6, a common mistake is incorrectly using the `useParams` hook outside of a component that is rendered within a route. This happens because `useParams` is designed to work only inside components that are part of a route's rendering hierarchy.  If you try to access `useParams` in a component higher up in the tree, or even outside of any routes altogether, you'll encounter the following error: `'useParams' hook was used outside of a route.  Make sure that your component is rendered within a `Route` element, otherwise you will have to make use of location object using useNavigate hook.
